# 010_AntAI
 Thias is the first Version of my Knowledge Database AntAI

AntAi is a knowledge database. The database is shipped empty with some examples and needs to be filled and maintained by the users. 
By using a hotkey or simple gui, the user can trigger AutoHotkey (AHK) scripts that search for 
a phrase in the database and display it in the browser via an HTML file.

There is a wiki available for the AntAi Tool:
https://github.com/THEKAEL/010_AntAI/wiki

Usually the current documentation does not refere to the latest features.
