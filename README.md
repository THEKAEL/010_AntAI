 Thias is the first Version of my Knowledge Database AntAI

AntAi is a knowledge database. The database is shipped empty and needs to be filled by the users. 
By using a hotkey, the user can trigger AutoHotkey (AHK) scripts that search for 
a phrase in the database and display it in the browser via an HTML file.

There is a wiki available for the AntAi Tool:
